## Location of cosmological experiments
Ground- and space-based cosmology experiments span a range of wavelengths, from X-rays to radio, to probe the universe’s structure and evolution.

### Ground-based experiments

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Cerro Pachón, Chile), Pan-STARRS, Subaru, CFHT (Maunakea, Hawaii, USA), VLT (Paranal, Chile), and CTAO (Cerro Tololo, Chile) have provided, provide, or will provide imaging in the optical and near-infrared. 4MOST (Cerro Paranal, Chile), APO/SDSS (Sunspot, New Mexico, USA), KPNO/DESI (Arizona, USA), and MUST (China) have provided, provide, or will provide wide-field spectroscopy.

In the microwave range, cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments include BICEP, Keck, and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) (South Pole, Antarctica), as well as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) (Atacama, Chile), Simons Observatory (Atacama, Chile), CMB-S4 (Atacama, Chile & South Pole, Antarctica), and NIKA2 (Pico Veleta, Spain).

In the radio domain, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) (Western Australia & South Africa) will be a leading radio observatory.

Lastly, LIGO (Louisiana, USA) and VIRGO (Cascina, Italy) detect gravitational waves.
