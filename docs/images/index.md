## Location of cosmological experiments
Ground- and space-based cosmology experiments span a range of wavelengths, from X-rays to radio, to probe the universe’s structure and evolution.

### Ground-based experiments

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory (Cerro Pachón, Chile) will conduct the 10-year Legacy of Space and Time (LSST) to be started in 2026. The Very Large Telescope - VLT (Paranal, Chile), and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory - CTIO (Cerro Tololo, Chile) have provided imaging datasets in the optical and near-infrared (respectively KiDS and DES). The Hawaii islands hosts the Pan-STARRS, the Subaru Observatory, and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). 

The Apache Point Observatory (APO) in Sunspot, New Mexico has conducted the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey - SDSS.  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) was installed on the Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPN0, Tucson, Arizona, USA). 4MOST is a spectroscopic instrument installed on the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA, Paranal Observatory, northern Chile). MUST (China) will provide wide-field spectroscopy.

In the microwave range, cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments include BICEP, Keck, and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) (South Pole, Antarctica), as well as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) (Atacama, Chile), Simons Observatory (Atacama, Chile), CMB-S4 (Atacama, Chile & South Pole, Antarctica), and NIKA2 (Pico Veleta, Spain).

In the radio domain, the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) (Western Australia & South Africa) will be a leading radio observatory.

Lastly, LIGO (Louisiana, USA) and VIRGO (Cascina, Italy) detect gravitational waves.
