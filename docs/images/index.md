## Location of cosmological experiments
Ground- and space-based cosmology experiments span a range of wavelengths, from X-rays to radio, to probe the universe’s structure and evolution.

### Ground-based experiments

- The **Vera C. Rubin Observatory** in Cerro Pachón, Chile, is set to begin the **10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in 2026**. The **Very Large Telescope (VLT)** in Paranal, Chile, and the **Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO)** in Cerro Tololo, Chile, have contributed optical and near-infrared imaging datasets, respectively, through **KiDS** (with the OmegaCam) and **DES** (with the DECam). The **Hawaiian Islands** are home to several significant observatories, including **Pan-STARRS**, the **Subaru Observatory**, and the **Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)**.  

- In the field of spectroscopy, the **Apache Point Observatory (APO)** in Sunspot, New Mexico, has conducted the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**. The **Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)** was installed on the **Mayall Telescope** at **Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO)** in Tucson, Arizona, USA. **4MOST**, a spectroscopic instrument, operates on the **Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)** at **Paranal Observatory** in northern Chile. Additionally, **MUST** in **China** will provide wide-field spectroscopy.  

- For cosmic microwave background (CMB) studies, key experiments include **BICEP**, **Keck**, and the **South Pole Telescope (SPT)** in **Antarctica**, as well as the **Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)**, the **Simons Observatory**, and **CMB-S4** in the **Atacama Desert, Chile, and the South Pole**. Another major CMB instrument, **NIKA2**, operates at **Pico Veleta, Spain**.  

- In the **radio astronomy domain**, the **Square Kilometer Array (SKA)**, located in **Western Australia and South Africa**, is set to become a leading radio observatory.  

- Finally, in the study of **gravitational waves**, **LIGO** in **Louisiana, USA**, and **VIRGO** in **Cascina, Italy**, play a crucial role in detection efforts.
